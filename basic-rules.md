#briefly:

in the nice defender your task is to defend nice family members represented by sprites at the bottom of the screen ![]() from relentless bombardment of communication from the youngest and somewhat disabled family member.


#the basis of the conflict

at the top of the screen we can see representation of our adversary ![]() who is a 26 year old, troublesome, yet almost invisible, family member in the past identified by some nice and authoritative source as a "black hole", "hateful" and "selfish" and who is known to be affected by "some" health condition since the age of 9.

this young and disabled mother of a six year old, creative and very energetic girl will relentlessly bombard our happy and unsuspecting gathering of nice family members with hateful pleas to show understanding of her condition and will make statements containing other information about symptoms and everyday problems she is facing none of which could be seen as "nice" and therefore is most likely lethal to our happy family gathering.  

#the nature of the condition or "sometimes she is better"

![]()

the double quoted text in the heading is literally the scope of understanding of the disability contracted by "hateful" family member some 15 years ago expressed on many occasions by most central figure among nice family members. it also seems the maximum capacity of other nice members of the family for controlled intake of information and claims about this difficult chronic health condition known as [chronic fatigue syndrome]().

#"why didn't you get diagnosed earlier?"

the condition being rather unusual and severely limiting recently started to capture greater attention from medical authorities and recently has been rebranded as [...]().

it is somewhat interesting to point out that in previous years this complex condition mustered rather minimal interest from general public which translated to inadequate understanding of its nuances by general medical practitioners. but also reflected almost complete ignorance as to its severity by general public which we might assume includes our nice family members.

#"i was nine and was always reminded that it isn't all about me!"

![little hannah and her never-ending hang-over]()

limited and highly subjective list of symptoms and hurdles faced by those affected by the condition were collated together by hannah and are based on her personal experience of the condition from which she is suffering since the age of 9. the creation of this list proved to be quite interesting but fairly difficult task ridden with its own peculiarities. the most intriguing one was related to the fact that Hannah being ill for most of her life cannot remember not being ill.

#something about the list and potential co-op's

the list is non-exclusive and it is rather certain that some other individuals who like hannah are affected by the condition might find the list presented here as somewhat limited. should this be the case in your case we would like to strongly encourage you to fork this repository and add to our list your own list of symptoms and subsequently create a pull request.

please refer to [section containing info re contributing to the development](), format of the text snippets and more detailed guidelines as to the styles and frameworks used in the development.

#"la la la la la la la"

on the other hand those who aren't familiar with the condition might find some difficulties presented here as trivial and might feel like taking more dismissive stance towards the onslaught. should this happen to you please be informed that communication of these symptoms no matter how trivial it might seem it can seriously disturb the peace of unsuspecting nice family members and lead to the end of the game.

do not underestimate these  

#"but..."

during 15 years of her personal struggle with unrecognized health condition Hannah stockpiled serious volume of ammunition represented in the game as speech bubbles with short text describing any particular symptom and which she will be launching at nice family members during the gameplay.

meteorites - ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ...

you as a player must protect nice family members by all means ensuring that their blissful bubble of ignorance remains intact as long as it is possible.

#"la la la la la la la"

in case you wonder how on earth would you be able to accomplish your main task you might be pleased finding out at the arsenal at your disposal. your main weapon is an extensive stock of mostly useless objects and gadgets gathered over the years during weekly trips around numerous charity shops in reading, uk.

these tokens allow for creation of illusion of supportive atmosphere and are proven method for shutting up the individual in need without need for any greater effort on the part of nice family members or - god forbid - any actual commitment to provide meaningful support.

love and support - ![]() ![]() ![]() ![]() ...

#on the crash course with the reality

it is certain you wont be able to withstand the onslaught for ever and the point of the game is to keep the nice family member's bubbles of ignorance intact for as long as possible. with passing time you will be growing your avoider status and you might receive additional support in form of powerful !["mantras"](), !["half-truths"]() and !["prejudices"]() which will help you stay longer in the game.

#!["i blame the mother"]() or journey towards master avoider level

here's the list of all the levels which you will have to clear on your journey to the master avoider level:

- "father figure" ![bill]()
- "ex-boyfriend" !["you dismissed yourself as a father"]()
- "uncle-01" ![witek]()
- "uncle-02" ![jeff]()
- "sara" ![]()
- "rachel" ![]()
- "jo" ![grandmother]()
- "kate the mother" ![]()

the last position on the list is the legendary, central to the whole circumstances depicted in the game level of master avoider. it requires no less but 15 years of successfully employing various avoidance techniques in order to assume no or token responsibility for disabled daughter.

#"wait a second, there's no boss in this game?!"

of course there is. what game would this be without nasty boss guarding the prize at the end of the gameplay? a poor one that's for sure, so here we give you the most nasty boss of them all: "rafal the nasty"!

![rafal the nasty]()

this terrible menace which is known to be picking bluebell at some point in time and handing it then to hannah will fight ferociously for recognition of her condition and will unceremoniously demand from nice family members serious commitment to tend to her needs. not a member of quaker society of any kind he will opt for rational free from emotions analysis of the problems and overall situation, using "jargon" and "reasoning" he will push for practical deliverables and long term plans completely uninterested in any "quick fixes" which happen to make up large part of the arsenal available to you even on master avoider level.

are you able to defeat this nasty creature? let's see...
