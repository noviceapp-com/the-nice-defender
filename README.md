what follows is an introduction to a 'hello world' html5 game with phaser.js.

here briefly a hacker's statement providing some explanation as to why's and wherefore's:

- making use of tools and practices in ways they weren't intended to be used and
- keeping in mind [it's all for the lulz](http://codepen.io/rafszul/pen/bNxwBx/)

as previously mentioned this hello-world app brings together awesome html5 game dev framework phaser.js

as always the process will involve some additional and somewhat unrelated tech exercises. currently on our plate we have manipulation and edits of svg graphics.

we aim at establishing set of workarounds for integration of more complex graphical compositions beefed up by batch processing and hooked to the browser with web standards.

looking through the tutorial we encountered a dilemma of a kind. to us bunnies seem somewhat inadequately dramatic and our preferred backdrop to the game would most definitely strive to get closer to the edges of reality.

the up shot was creation/adaptation of whole new set of assets which matched insanely twisted tales provided by [![@tala703](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7087282?v=3&s=460)](https://github.com/tala703) [@tala703]([@tala703](https://github.com/tala703) based on her experiences of reality and her surprising adventures in the jungle of everyday life.
