i'll be trying whatever comes along and makes dev of simple interactive slideshow even simplier

svg, xml and some basic js would be the ideal

but i'll sure try to experiment with various web tech

- starting as simple splash scr with svg in html [+]
- moving on to some examples from the [orbit](http://orbit.bonsaijs.org/) and [bonsai.js](http://bonsaijs.org/)

> “The art of bonsai tells a story through living illusion. A bonsai artist searches for ways to express his personal creativity by mixing form and thought in a miniature world.“

- some svg but not sure why anymore

###what's the point

as side-note we aim at establishing set of workarounds for integration of more complex graphical compositions beefed up by batch processing and hooked to the browser with web standards.

what follows below is a fragment from deprecated [README.md](README-deprecated-phaser.md)

###so... let's do it!

at first since bunnies seem somewhat inadequately dramatic and our preferred backdrop to the game would most definitely strive to get closer to the edges of reality even if not exactly by use of super advanced mechanics and tech but at least in terms of atmosphere and ... vocabulary? ...theme?

anyway the upshot was getting rid of the bunnies ans creation/adaptation of whole new set of assets which we paired up with insanely twisted tales provided by [@tala703](https://github.com/tala703) [![@tala703](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7087282?v=3&s=460)](https://github.com/tala703) which she bravely based on her own experiences of reality with all the surprising adventures of everyday life as they would appear to every robot with drained, damaged or otherwise malfunctioning battery or any other energy source.
