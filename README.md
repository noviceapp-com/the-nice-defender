what follows is an introduction to a 'hello world' html5 game with phaser.js.

here briefly a hacker's statement providing some explanation as to why's and wherefore's:

- making use of tools and practices in ways they weren't intended to be used and
- keeping in mind [it's all for the lulz](http://codepen.io/rafszul/pen/bNxwBx/)

as previously mentioned this hello-world app brings together awesome html5 game dev framework phaser.js

as always the process will involve some additional and somewhat unrelated tech exercises. currently on our plate we have manipulation and edits of svg graphics so this will serve as the main theme.

as side-note we aim at establishing set of workarounds for integration of more complex graphical compositions beefed up by batch processing and hooked to the browser with web standards.

###so... let's do it!

at first since bunnies seem somewhat inadequately dramatic and our preferred backdrop to the game would most definitely strive to get closer to the edges of reality even if not exactly by use of super advanced mechanics and tech but at least in terms of atmosphere and ... vocabulary? ...theme?

anyway the upshot was getting rid of the bunnies ans creation/adaptation of whole new set of assets which we paired up with insanely twisted tales provided by [@tala703](https://github.com/tala703) [![@tala703](https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/7087282?v=3&s=460)](https://github.com/tala703) which she bravely based on her own experiences of reality with all the surprising adventures of everyday life as they would appear to every robot with drained, damaged or otherwise malfunctioning battery or any other energy source.
